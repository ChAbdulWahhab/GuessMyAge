# Guess Game

A small interactive project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is simple: the user enters their name, birth year, and the current year. The app then calculates the user's age and displays a short personalized message in a popup.

## How it Works

When the user clicks the button, the script asks for three things:

1. Full name
2. Birth year
3. Present year

If the inputs are valid, a popup appears showing a greeting along with the calculated age. If anything is missing or invalid, the user gets a short reminder to try again.

## Features

* Clean and minimal UI
* Age calculation based on user input
* Popup animation for messages
* Simple structure that makes it beginner friendly
